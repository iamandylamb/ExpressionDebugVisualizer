# Expression Debug Visualizer
A [Debug Visualizer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/create-custom-visualizers-of-data) for Visual Studio that renders a binary decision tree for any .NET [Expression](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.expressions.expression).

This project has been moved from a private project held at [andylamb.visualstudio.com](https://andylamb.visualstudio.com/DevFun/_versionControl?path=%24/DevFun/BinaryDecisionTree). The project will now be maintained publically here.

The project hasn't been updated recently, the last release was in October 2016 for Visual Studio 2017.
One of the reasons it hasn't been updated is that in later versions of Visual Studio, the DGML rendering is only available under the Enterprise version.
