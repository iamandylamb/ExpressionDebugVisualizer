Title: Expression Debug Visualizer

Version: 1.1.0

Summary
--------------------------------------------------
A debug visualizer that renders a lambda expression as a binary decision tree.

Detail
--------------------------------------------------
Rendering complex lambda expressions as binary decision trees makes them easier to reason about for technical and non-technical users. Trace the flow through the decision tree following true and false branches at each node until a leaf is reached.
Note: The expression must be bound to a variable to support debugging tool tips and, therefore, debug visualizers. 
Usage: Hover over a lambda expression variable name whilst debugging to display its value in a tool tip. Click on the magnifying glass icon in the tool tip to load the Expression Debug Visualizer.
